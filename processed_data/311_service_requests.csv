 Mr Hawks, 
 
 Thank you for your patience. I regret to advise you that our IT department does not take requests from outside sources for unblocking. If any airport staff use Topica for work-related information and are not receiving emails, they will have to initiate an unblocking request.

 Dear Samedy,
 
 
 In response to your question regarding changing your business name, you need to first clarify whether you are changing Trade Name/DBA name or the Ownership name. Please look at the business information stated on your San Francisco Business Registration Certificate.
 
 
 Changing the Trade Name/DBA (Doing Business As) name:
 
 - You can update it at our online business information update link at our website by selecting ""adding a business location"" and indicate the new business name for that business location. 
 
 Below is the link to our online update:
 
 https://etaxstatement.sfgov.org/accountupdate/
 
 Changing/updating the ""Ownership"" Name is not allowed in the existing business account.
 
 - You may not update this information. This requires you to open a new business registration account under the new ownership name.
 
 
 **However, if you meet the circumstances, you may submit change request by mail, in-person, or fax a completed Update Business Information Paper Form (see attachment) and you must be able to provide/include both documentations below:
 
 1) Letter from the Secretary of State verifying transfer/change of the old ownership business name to the new ownership business name.
 
 2) Letter from the IRS stating the same tax EIN number has been transferred from the old ownership name to the new ownership business name.
 
 You need to complete the ""other changes to account information"" section of the paper form.\",Treasurer/Tax Collector - G,General Request - TT COLLECTOR,other,tt_collector - other,Not associated with a specific address,,,,Web,,0.0,0.0,

Dirty or discolored (rusty, yellow, brown) is typically caused by sediments that have become stirred up inside of a water main or pipe. Any increase in water velocity through a pipe or main can cause increased friction against pipe walls that can stir up sediments. Common causes are main breaks, shutdown of a facility, loss of pressure or the opening of a fire hydrant in the immediate area.
Recommendation
First, avoid using your hot water so that you don’t draw discolored water into your water heater or boiler. Next check to see if the water supplying your home or business is clear or dirty/discolored. To do this, open a tap (cold water) on the ground floor as close to your water meter (located in the sidewalk) as possible. Typically this would be a hose bibb in front of the house or just inside the garage door, or a downstairs utility sink. Run the water for 3-5 minutes to see if it runs clear. If not, turn off the tap and repeat periodically about every 45-60 minutes. You should see your water progressively clear. It may take several hours depending upon the severity of the discoloration. When the water runs clear at the ground floor tap, flush out your plumbing by opening faucets and flushing toilets inside your home or business. If your hot water does not run clear, it is possible that the dirty/discolored water has entered water heater or boiler. For safety reasons it is recommended that you call PG&E or a plumber to flush the water heater or boiler.",311 Supervisor Queue,Sewer Issues,other,na,"257 LAKESHORE DR, SAN FRANCISCO, CA, 94132",7.0,,"(37.730672145, -122.497329597)",Mobile/Open311,http://mobile311.sfgov.org/media/san_francisco/report/photos/59ef65bd5246092a958ffde0/report.jpg,37.73062,-122.4974,TARAVAL
